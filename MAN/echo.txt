       \xHH   byte with hexadecimal value HH (1 to 2 digits)

       NOTE:  your shell may have its own version of echo, which usually supersedes the version de‐
       scribed here.  Please refer to your shell's documentation for details about the  options  it
       supports.

       NOTE:  printf(1)  is  a  preferred  alternative,  which  does not have issues outputting op‐
       tion-like strings.
